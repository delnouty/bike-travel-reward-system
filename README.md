# Bike Travel Reward System
This project is a reward system designed to encourage and incentivize bicycle commuting. 
## Tech Stack:
* **Streamlit** for the web interface.
* **Python** for backend logic and trip optimization.
* **Docker** for containerization.
* **Git** for version control.

## Project Phases

### Stage 1: Requirements Gathering and System Design

**Objective**: To gather and document all necessary requirements for the system to understand the functionality that needs to be implemented. This includes:

1. **User Needs Research**:
   - Conduct surveys or interviews with potential users to determine which features of the system are most important to them.
   - Collect feedback on existing reward systems (if any) to identify their strengths and weaknesses.

2. **Define Functional Requirements**:
   - Compile a list of key functions, such as:
     - User registration and authentication.
     - Ability to input and edit trip data.
     - Automatic calculation of rewards based on entered data.
     - Displaying trip history and earned rewards.

3. **Create Interface Prototypes**:
   - Develop user interface (UI) mockups using tools like Figma or Sketch.
   - Discuss the mockups with the team and potential users to gather feedback.

4. **Technical Design**:
   - Select a technology stack (e.g., using Streamlit for the frontend and Python for the backend).
   - Define the system architecture, including the database, APIs, and algorithms needed for calculating routes and rewards.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Create documentation that includes functional requirements, architectural decisions, and development plans.
   - Prepare materials for the development team to ensure everyone is aligned on the project's goals and objectives.

### Expected Outcomes

- A clear understanding of user requirements and system functionality.
- An interface prototype that serves as the foundation for further development.
- Detailed documentation to help the development team implement the project on time and in accordance with user expectations.

### Completion of the Stage

Upon completion of this stage, a presentation of the gathered materials and the prototype will be held to ensure that all team members agree on the requirements and directions before moving on to the next phase of development.
